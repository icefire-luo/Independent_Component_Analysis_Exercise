    "Apaply the stochastic on-line learning rule (3.37), choosing a random inital point $\\mathbf{w}$ and an appropriate learning rate. Try different choices for the learning rate and see how it effects the convergence speed. Then, try to solve the same problem using a batch learning rule by taking the averages on the right-hand side. Compare the computational efforts of the on-line $vs.$ batch learning rules at one step of the iteration, and the number of the steps needed for convergence in both algorithms. (*Note:* The algorithm convergens to the dominant eigenvector of the covariance matrix, which can be solved in closed form)."
